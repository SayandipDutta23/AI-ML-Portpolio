        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          My journey in the world of technology has been exciting. I am passionate about learning and exploring new frontiers. I believe in the power of AI and its potential to transform industries and improve lives. My goal is to contribute to this transformation through innovative solutions and cutting-edge research. I aspire to be a part of groundbreaking projects that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

        <p>
          With a strong foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I have developed a solid understanding of the underlying principles of AI. I am always eager to dive into new challenges and apply my skills to real-world problems. My experiences in Data Science and AI have taught me the importance of data-driven decision-making and the impact it can have on businesses and society.

          Beyond my technical pursuits, I am also passionate about astronomy and have been recognized for my achievements in the field. Ranking among the top 12 students in the Astronomy Olympiad in West Bengal and being a scholar of JBNSTS (Jagadis Bose National Science Talent Search) have been highlights of my academic journey.
